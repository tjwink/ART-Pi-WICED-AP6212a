* Removed API function wiced_wifi_ap_swap_channel()
* Added API function wiced_wifi_get_rssi()
* Added API function wiced_management_wifi_on() / _wifi_off() 
* API documentation improvements
* Added support for WPA & WPA2 security to AP mode
* Build system now handles directory names with spaces
* Added build instructions and patches for OpenOCD
* Added 'run' make target to reset and run the target platform
* canned_send application : stability improvements
* web server application : stability improvements
* mdns_listen application : now prints instance name as well as the service name
* console application : added
* mfg_test application : Fixed memory leak, updated mfg firmware image to 4.218.116.43 
* Updated BCM4319 firmware to ROMTERM2 v4.219.77.9
* Updated WICED EVB serial port driver to FTDI 2.08.14
* OpenOCD fix to stop suspended threads from occasionally vanishing from the debugger   


Changes for WICED-SDK-0.6 : 17 June 2011
----------------------------------------
* Reformatted all Broadcom code to use a uniform coding style
* Memory usage reduction, including:
   - Better control of stack and packet buffer sizes
   - Remove printf() usage from WICED and TCP/IP threads to reduce stack requirement
   - Remove all printf() usage from the release build of the canned_send app to minimize RAM usage
   - FreeRTOS and LwIP now use malloc/free functions from libc (newlib)
* Moved Wi-Fi firmware image from header file to .c file.
* Standardised usage of stdint.h types and changed bool to wiced_bool_t to avoid clashes
* Wi-Fi firmware download improvements to minimise download time
* Added join failure reasons to wiced_wifi_is_ready_to_transceive() API
* Minimized delay on AP startup
* Changed RTOS semaphores from binary to counting
* Reduced Broadcom Wi-Fi device boot delay
* Added a 'throughput test' to the web_server app
* Added manufacturing test application (mfg_test)
* Added mdns listen application to demonstrate usage of multicast (FreeRTOS/LwIP only)
* Added support for AMPAK EVB and E225413 WICED module
* Removed support for STM3210E_Eval board
* A summary of flash and memory usage is now printed as part of the build process
* Added toolchain support for IAR Embedded Workbench (for ThreadX/NetX)
   - Many IAR code compatibility changes
   - Assembly code moved into separate GCC / IAR directories
* Build system speed and dependency improvements
* Fixed GDB debugging on Linux


Changes for WICED-SDK-0.5 : 17 May 2011
---------------------------------------
* Added APSTA mode
* Added 802.11 powersave mode
* Added WEP security
* Added API to set Tx RF power output
* Added sensor report application to demonstrate AP mode, DHCP server and low power
* Added support for multicast (beta) 
* STM32 sleep enabled during RTOS idle
* Changes to the way wiced_join() manages event handling
* Fixed occasional SDIO read timeout  
* Build system changes for improved error reporting and speed 
* Debugger now supports thread awareness and is considerably faster
* UART read fixed
* Fixed issue with WPA TKIP that prevents join
* Changed Scan and Ping app names to lowercase 


Changes for WICED-SDK-0.4 : 31 March 2011
-----------------------------------------
* wiced_wifi_join() API function is now non-blocking
* wiced_wifi_check_joined() API function has been added
* wiced_management_set_event_handler() API function now accepts an array of events per handler and allows overlapping event handlers
* wiced_wifi_scan() now uses a callback to communicate when a new scan record is available and added extended scanning options.
